## Task 1: Front-End Setup with React (Intermediate Level)

    Goal: Build a simple landing page using ReactJS. The landing page should have:
        A header with navigation links (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
        A hero section with a large image, some text, and a call-to-action button.
        A footer with social media icons (you can use font-awesome).
    Requirements:
        Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
        Apply CSS modules to style components, keeping your styles organized.
        Make the page responsive using media queries.
    React Features to Use:
        Functional components
        React hooks (useState for toggling mobile menu if needed)
        Props for passing data into reusable components like the navigation bar.

## Task 2: Back-End Setup with Node.js & Express (Beginner Level)

    Goal: Set up a simple back-end server using Node.js and Express.
        Create a route for handling a GET request to /api/test, which returns a JSON response: { message: "Hello from the backend!" }.
        Install required dependencies like express and set up the project structure.
    Requirements:
        Ensure you have Node.js and Express installed.
        Create separate files for routing logic (e.g., create a routes folder).
        Ensure your server is running on localhost:5000.

## Task 3: Git Version Control (Best Practice)

    Goal: Initialize a Git repository and push your code to GitHub.
        Create a new GitHub repository.
        Set up .gitignore to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files.
        Commit your code and push it to the new repository.

Day 1 Deliverables:

    React Front-End: A working, styled landing page with responsive design.
    Node.js Back-End: A working Express server with one GET route.
    GitHub Repository: Code pushed to GitHub with clear commit messages.
